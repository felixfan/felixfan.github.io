{{ site.about }}

I am a postdoctoral fellow in The University of Hong Kong.    

I am working in the field of human complex disease research, with specialization in bioinformatics and statistical genetics. My research includes genome wide association studies, exome sequencing, whole genome sequencing, RNA-seq, pathway analysis, candidate gene study, linkage analysis, machine learning, and software development.

## Tools I have developed

***

#### IPGWAS: Integrated Pipeline for Genome-Wide Association Studies

IPGWAS was developed to facilitate the identification of the rational thresholds in QC of GWAS datasets, association analysis, Manhattan plot, quantile-quantile (QQ) plot, and format conversion for genetic analyses, such as meta-analysis, genotype phasing, and imputation. IPGWAS is a multiplatform application written in Perl with a graphical user interface (GUI).  

IPGWAS is available at [sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/ipgwas/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/felixfan/IPGWAS).

#### FinCal: Time Value of Money, time series analysis and Computational Finance

FinCal is a R Package for time value of money calculation, time series analysis and computational finance. Currently, the fuctions are as following:

* Financial calculator for time value money: PV, FV, N, PMT, I/Y
* NPV, IRR
* Methods for downloading historical stock prices from Yahoo finance and Google finance
* Technical analysis
* Cost of goods sold and ending inventory under three methods (FIFO,LIFO,Weighted average)

More details and examples of using FinCal is available [here](http://felixfan.github.io/FinCal/)

FinCal is available at [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/FinCal/index.html) and [GitHub](https://github.com/felixfan/FinCal)

#### PubMedWordcloud: PubMed Word Clouds

PubMedWordcloud is a R Package for creating a word cloud using the abstract of publications from PubMed. PubMedWordcloud makes it easy to created a word cloud using the abstracts of your publications to represent a visual description of your work.

More details and examples of using PubMedWordcloud is available [here](http://felixfan.github.io/PubMedWordcloud/)

PubMedWordcloud is available at [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/PubMedWordcloud/index.html) and [GitHub](https://github.com/felixfan/PubMedWordcloud)

#### Chi-Square Calculator

A Java tool computes cumulative probabilities, based on the chi-square statistic.    

* 2 x 2 contingency table.
* 2 x 3 contingency table.
* chi-square statistic and degrees of freedom

ChiSquareCalculator is available at [GitHub](http://felixfan.github.io/ChiSquareCalculator/)
