Pedigree plot using {kinship2}
==================================


```r
library(kinship2)
data(sample.ped)
sample.ped2 = subset(sample.ped, ped == 2)
sample.ped2
```

```
   ped  id father mother sex affected avail
42   2 201      0      0   1        1     1

### Simple plot   


```r
pedAll <- pedigree(id = sample.ped2$id, dadid = sample.ped2$father, momid = sample.ped2$mother, 
    sex = sample.ped2$sex, famid = sample.ped2$ped)
print(pedAll)
```

```
Pedigree list with 14 total subjects in 1 families
```

```r
print(pedAll["2"])
```

```
Pedigree object with 14 subjects, family id= 2 
Bit size= 16 
```

```r
plot(pedAll["2"])
```

![plot of chunk kinship1](figure/kinship1.png) 


Since there is only one family, or     


```r
pedAll <- pedigree(id = sample.ped2$id, dadid = sample.ped2$father, momid = sample.ped2$mother, 
    sex = sample.ped2$sex, )
print(pedAll)
```

```
Pedigree object with 14 subjects
Bit size= 16 
```

```r
plot(pedAll)
```

![plot of chunk kinship2](figure/kinship2.png) 


* Squares and circles indicate males and females, respectively.     

### Add affection status


```r
pedAll <- pedigree(id = sample.ped2$id, dadid = sample.ped2$father, momid = sample.ped2$mother, 
    sex = sample.ped2$sex, affected = sample.ped2$affected)
print(pedAll)
```

```
Pedigree object with 14 subjects
Bit size= 16 
```

```r
plot(pedAll)
```

![plot of chunk kinship3](figure/kinship3.png) 


* Blackened squares and circles indicate the affected males and females, respectively.       
* Squares and circles with a central question mark represent affection status is unknown.

### Add status (0="censored", 1="dead")

Suppose the first individual (ID=201) is dead.      


```r
sample.ped2$status = c(1, rep(0, 13))
pedAll <- pedigree(id = sample.ped2$id, dadid = sample.ped2$father, momid = sample.ped2$mother, 
    sex = sample.ped2$sex, affected = sample.ped2$affected, status = sample.ped2$status)
print(pedAll)
```

```
Pedigree object with 14 subjects
Bit size= 16 
```

```r
plot(pedAll)
```

![plot of chunk kinship4](figure/kinship4.png) 


* Squares and circles with a slash represent deceased.

### Add relationship (1=Monozygotic twin, 2=Dizygotic twin, 3=Twin of unknown zygosity, 4=Spouse)

Suppose 210 and 211 are monozygotic twin, 212 and 213 are dizygotic twin, create a matrix with 3 columns (id1, id2, code) specifying special relationship between pairs of individuals.     


```r
id1 = c(210, 212)
id2 = c(211, 213)
r = c(1, 2)
rm = cbind(id1, id2, r)
```



```r
pedAll <- pedigree(id = sample.ped2$id, dadid = sample.ped2$father, momid = sample.ped2$mother, 
    sex = sample.ped2$sex, affected = sample.ped2$affected, status = sample.ped2$status, 
    relation = rm)
print(pedAll)
```

```
Pedigree object with 14 subjects
Bit size= 16 
```

```r
plot(pedAll)
```
