Examples 27 Inventory Expense Recognition -- cost of goods sold
------------------------------------------------
Three methods: first-in, first-out (FIFO) method; last-in, first-out (LIFO) method; weighted average cost method.

e.g. during one month   
beginning inventory: 20 units @ $2/unit   
buy                : 30 units @ $3/unit    
buy                : 50 units @ $5/unit    
sold               : 70 units    
what is the cost of goods sold using three menthod?   

```r
# first-in, first-out (FIFO) method
cogs(uinv = 20, pinv = 2, units = c(30, 50), price = c(3, 5), sinv = 70, method = "FIFO")
```

```
$costOfGoods
[1] 230

$endingInventory
[1] 150
```

```r
# last-in, first-out (LIFO) method
cogs(uinv = 20, pinv = 2, units = c(30, 50), price = c(3, 5), sinv = 70, method = "LIFO")
```

```
$costOfGoods
[1] 310

$endingInventory
[1] 70
```

```r
# weighted average cost method
cogs(uinv = 20, pinv = 2, units = c(30, 50), price = c(3, 5), sinv = 70, method = "WAC")
```

```
$costOfGoods
[1] 266

$endingInventory
[1] 114
```


Example 28 Depreciation Expense Recognition
----------------------------------------------
Methods: straight line depreciation method, double-declining balance (DDB)   
e.g.,   
One Company recently purchased a machine at a cost of $9,800. The machine is expected to have a residual value of $2,000 at the end of its useful life in five years. What is the depreciation expense for all five years using two different menthods?  


```r
# straight line depreciation method
slde(cost = 9800, rv = 2000, t = 5)
```

```
[1] 1560
```

```r
# double-declining balance (DDB)
ddb(cost = 9800, rv = 2000, t = 5)
```

```
     t    ddb
[1,] 1 3920.0
[2,] 2 2352.0
