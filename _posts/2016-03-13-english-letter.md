K.I.S.S. (Keep it simple, stupid!) 尽量简洁。人们每天要接收大量邮件，所以确保你的邮件简单易懂和思路清晰。

例如，如果是要求开会，就不需要过多的铺垫，直接写明时间、地点等主要因素就够了。

Meeting Request: Let’s have our weekly meeting on Feb 18th , at 10:30 AM in Meeting room.

@Lisa, could you please take the meeting minutes this time.

@Chris, please buy some snacks and drinks for each person.

订于2月18日早上10:30在2号会议室开周例会，请Lisa做会议纪要，请Chris为每个人准备点心和饮品。
```

写英文邮件时，记得介绍自己、说清你想要什么——务必简明扼要地自我介绍，使收件人了解邮件的目的。

例如：Jane作为上海区域经理加入了A公司，她整理了客户资料后给John发了一封邮件：

Hi John, Hope this mail finds you well. I am Jane, SH regional manager from A; I’m contacting you today regarding our upcoming collaboration.

你好John，见信安好。我是A公司的上海区域经理Jane。这封邮件是关于接下来双方合作的事宜。
```

```
醒目的标题。务必使收件人看完标题后一目了然。

范例：市场部员工小美去电视台采访，偶遇老同学，顺便为公司谈了一个合作，她回到办公室给老板发邮件，题目是Potential marketing recourse with xx TV的邮件。

有时候，一个标题就可以说清楚邮件内容，甚至正文都可以免了。
```

```
强调关键信息，再阐明具体要求-如果你需要他人在时间期限内完成某事，请清晰明了地表达对时限和任务的要求。

例如：HR小琪给刚入职的Bruce发邮件： It is VERY IMPORTANT that we go through the visa procedure soon tomorrow . Please MEET with me at 13:00 on the 7th floor of the office for this to be done.

明天最重要的是签证手续尽量早点办完，请在下午1:00到7楼的办公室与我见面。
```

```
根据信息的重要程度由上而下的沟通—确保把最关键的信息在邮件中置顶。老外喜欢开门见山，但单刀直入，邮件中要尽量避免过多不必要的寒暄，确保最重要的信息最先被对方知晓。

例如：老板发邮件给市场全体员工说明市场部主管Jane延迟入职的原因。

Jane will not be able to join us until March 15th. This is because of the rules surrounding her current contract. She will still be able to join us for the seminar on the Feb. 8th.

因为Jane目前合同一些条款的规定，在3月15日之前不能加入我们。她仍然会在2月8日参加我们的研讨会。
```

```
署名信息到位-确保你的署名包含你的业务领域，部门信息，头衔以及联系方式，以便收件人更清晰地了解你。

例如：

Best Wishes,
Lucy. Yang
Sales Manager
XXXX Company
1/F XXX Plaza, XX Street,Shanghai, China
Tel: +86 133 XXXXXXX Skype: *****
www.XXXXXX.com

Sometimes by reading your signature people can know if they are talking to the right person.
有的时候一个完整的署名能够直观地展示您的权限与兴趣点，省去很多不必要的沟通。
```
