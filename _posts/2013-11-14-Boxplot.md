### Basic boxplot

Add **varwidth=TRUE** to make boxplot widths proportional to the square root of the samples sizes. Add **horizontal=TRUE** to reverse the axis orientation.


```r
boxplot(mpg ~ cyl, data = mtcars, main = "Car Milage Data", xlab = "Number of Cylinders", 
    ylab = "Miles Per Gallon")
```

### Notched Boxplot     

#### Notched Boxplot of Tooth Growth Against 2 Crossed Factors. 

* boxes colored for ease of interpretation.               

```r
boxplot(len ~ supp * dose, data = ToothGrowth, notch = TRUE, col = (c("gold", 
    "darkgreen")), main = "Tooth Growth", xlab = "Suppliment and Dose")
```

![plot of chunk boxplot8](/figure/boxplot8.png) 

```
In the notched boxplot, if two boxes' notches do not overlap this is ‘strong evidence’ their
medians differ (Chambers et al., 1983, p. 62). 
```

* Colors recycle. 

```
In the example above, if I had listed 6 colors, each box would have its own color. 
Earl F. Glynn has created an easy to use [list of colors](http://research.stowers-institute.org/efg/R/Color/Chart/ColorChart.pdf) is PDF format.            
```

### Other Options      


The **boxplot.matrix()** function in the [sfsmisc](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sfsmisc/index.html) package draws a boxplot for each column (row) in a matrix. 

The **boxplot.n()** function in the [gplots](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gplots/index.html) package annotates each boxplot with its sample size. 

The ** bplot()** function in the [Rlab](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rlab/index.html) package offers many more options controlling the positioning and labeling of boxes in the output.

### Violin Plots     

A violin plot is a combination of a boxplot and a [kernel density](http://www.statmethods.net/graphs/density.html) plot. They can be created using the **vioplot()** function from [vioplot](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vioplot/index.html) package.        


```r
library(vioplot)
x1 <- mtcars$mpg[mtcars$cyl == 4]
x2 <- mtcars$mpg[mtcars$cyl == 6]
x3 <- mtcars$mpg[mtcars$cyl == 8]
vioplot(x1, x2, x3, names = c("4 cyl", "6 cyl", "8 cyl"), col = "gold")

```

### Bagplot - A 2D Boxplot Extension


```r
library(aplpack)
attach(mtcars)
bagplot(wt, mpg, xlab = "Car Weight", ylab = "Miles Per Gallon", main = "Bagplot Example")
```
