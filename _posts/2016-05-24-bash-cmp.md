## 1. 整数比较大小

```
a=5
b=4
c=5
```

```
if [ $a -ne $b ]; then
    echo "$a is not equal to $b"
else
    echo "$a is equal to $b"
fi
```

```
5 is not equal to 4
```

```
if [ $a -lt $b ]; then
    echo "$a is less than $b"
else
    echo "$a is not less than $b"
fi
```

```
5 is not less than 4
```

```
if [ $a -gt $b ]; then
    echo "$a is great than $b"
else
    echo "$a is not great than $b"
fi
```

```
5 is great than 4
```

```
if [ $a -ge $b ]; then
    echo "$a is great than or equal to $b"
else
    echo "$a is less than $b"
fi
```

```
5 is great than or equal to 4
```

```
if [ $a -le $c ]; then
    echo "$a is less than or equal to $c"
else
    echo "$a is great than $b"
fi
```

```
5 is less than or equal to 5
```

```
if (($a != $b )); then
    echo "$a is not equal to $b"
else
    echo "$a is equal to $b"
fi
```

```
5 is not equal to 4
```

```
if (($a < $b)); then
    echo "$a is less than $b"
else
    echo "$a is not less than $b"
fi
```

```
5 is not less than 4
```

```
if (($a > $b)); then
    echo "$a is great than $b"
else
    echo "$a is not great than $b"
fi
```

```
5 is great than 4
```

```
if (($a >= $b)); then
    echo "$a is great than or equal to $b"
else
    echo "$a is less than $b"
fi
```

```
5 is great than or equal to 4
```

```
if (($a <= $c)); then
    echo "$a is less than or equal to $c"
else
    echo "$a is great than $b"
fi
```

```
5 is less than or equal to 5
```

## 2. 小数比较大小

```
e=20.0
d=100.50
```

```
awk -v a=0.7 -v b=0.5 'BEGIN{print(a>b)?"a is big":"b is big"}'
```

```
a is big
```

```
c=`echo "$d > $e" | bc`
if [ $c -eq 1 ]; then
    echo "$d is great than $e"
else
    echo "$d is less than or equal to $e"
fi
```

```
100.50 is great than 20.0
```

## 3. 字符串大小比较

```
s1='a'
s2='b'
s3='ac'
```

```
if [ $s1 == $s2 ]; then
    echo "$s1 is equal to $s2"
else
    echo "$s1 is not equal to $s2"
fi
```

```
a is not equal to b
```

```
if [ $s1 != $s3 ]; then
    echo "$s1 is not equal to $s3"
else
    echo "$s1 is equal to $s3"
fi
```

```
a is not equal to ac
```

```
if [ $s1 \< $s2 ]; then
    echo "$s1 is less than $s2"
elif [[ $s1 > $s2 ]]; then
    echo "$s1 is great than $2"
else
    echo "$s1 is equal to $s2"
fi
```

```
a is less than b
```

```
if [[ $s1 < $s3 ]]; then
    echo "$s1 is less than $s3"
elif [ $s1 \> $s3 ]; then
    echo "$s1 is great than $3"
else
    echo "$s1 is equal to $s3"
fi
```

```
a is less than ac
```
